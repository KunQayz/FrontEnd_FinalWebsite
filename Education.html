<h1>Moat Community College</h1>
<p>
This was secondary school, I achieved all my GCSE's at this school.
I studied English, Maths, Science, Subsidary Engineering, Product design
and the most important one Level 3 ICT.
<br>
<br>
Engineering was based on creating a project that was based on making a circuit
which is used to function a Jitterbug. 
<br>
<br>
Product Design was also about creating a project, this module was based over 2 years where we had 
research and analyse docking station. After the research and analysing, we had create our own docking station
using different types of materials.
<br>
<br>
Finally, ICT was also based over 2 years and it consists of 12 modules. Over these 2 years I enhanced my 
ICT skills very well. For example I improved on reporting and creating databses skills. From here on I 
decided to take on ICT as my future plans because I found it really intresting.

<h1>Regent College</h1>
<p>
My next step foward was College, I chose to attend Regent College. The 2 courses I went 
ahead with was Graphics design and Subsidary Diploma ICT. I achieved my A levels at this college.
<br>
<br>
Graphics Design was a course which was based over 2 years, A level and A2 level. I was struggling at
first with the different types of softwares that were being used, and because I was not a very good
artist I struggled. Once I got the hang of it, I was fine. Graphics required me to take phtographs and create
illustrations using Adobe Illustratoir and Photoshop. This course helped me enhance my photography skills, as well as
my photoshop skills.
<br>
<br>
ICT Subsidary Diploma was my second module I chose to go with. This was the course I looked foward to 
the most. This is because I was very intrested in the ICT sector and I could see myself working in this sector in the future.
This course required me to work with Databases, Reporting, Web design etc.

<h1>De Montfort University</h1>
<p>
My final step towards my goal was attending university. I chose to go with DMU, this was 
becasue this university had my course I wanted to learn and it was in my hometown, therefore
I chose to go with it. The First year the course required me to create Databases and then link it 
with a report, another module I did was Visual web Devlopment, this module was very good as I was introduced
to coding for the first time. At the end first year I finsihed with a 1st. Moving into yr 2, this year was the hardest 
as we had to create a system in a module known as Team development, another module required me to create MVC
project which I did manage to do well. I am finally in my final year and hoping to finish on a high.
