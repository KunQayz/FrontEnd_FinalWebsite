# Project summary 
For this assignment, I was assigned to create a HTML 5 website which had a responsive design and was compatible with a mobile phone as well as a desktop PC. I chose to go with a website which was around me, so it was like a blog website, I chose to go with this idea as I thought it would be easier and there would be less research needed. I have learnt a lot of things during this module, a very key one is that when creating a HTML 5 website planning is very key, this is so when you have planned everything out, it is easier when designing/implementing the real website. Another one would be, while creating the website make sure to remember that the target audience does not have issues navigating around the website, so a very key aspect I chose to concentrate on was the navigation of my pages, as well as making the pages responsive for mobile users. During this assignment, I would like to achieve the things mentioned above. Below this I have discussed my development process, as well as all the functions and issues I faced while creating this website, as well as how I fixed it.

# Early design ideas
At the beginning, I chose to create a website themed around a Zoo, the website was going to be based around a Zoo, which will have content like what kind of animals there are, tickets etc. I chose to have 4 pages which would be Homepage, Animals, Tickets and About Zoo page. After implementing some of the ideas, I found that the website was quite boring therefore I decided to change my idea to a website based around be therefore I change it to a blog website.

# Implementing, Structuring and Layouts
My new idea was a blog page, I started fresh and first of all decided how many pages I will have and also the colour combinations and contrasts. I chose to have 4 pages and made sure my website had a decent colour combination. Below I have listed the pages I will have.

-	Homepage
-	About me
-	Education & Skills
-	Contact me

Also, I decided to make my pages responsive on mobile phones as well a normal desktop pc view. This is so the target audience wouldn’t need to be on a PC to view my website, also its more professional when its compatible on more than one device. I will also try to make sure my layout, structure and consistency of my website remains balanced as this will keep the website at a good usability and accessibility level.

Target Audience, Colour contrasts, Font Management
Target audience – My target audience can be aimed for everyone but, I chose to go with third year university student mainly this was because, students that are in their final year and are doing the same course can have a look at the website and they can get an idea of how it is.

Colour Contrasts -  I chose to make my website quite simple and plain, therefore I mainly chose to have a plain white background, but I will be using different colours for the navigation bar, as well changing the font colours on some pages. I chose colours that mainly contrasts with white, so colours like blue, red, green etc.

Font Management- Throughout my whole website I chose to have different types of fonts on different sections of the website. For example, the logo will have a different font, the content will have different font and the homepage title will have a unique font. The sizing of the font is yet to be decided, but I have chosen to make it readable for all platforms.

# Git Commits & Branching

Below is a image where I uploaded my website and where I did my commits, it also has my repositories and my branches.

# Prototypes
I created 2 different prototypes. One was created by hand sketch, this prototype had all the pages drawn out with key labelling’s. Another prototype I chose to create was a computerized PowerPoint, this prototype also had all the content that will exist on the website. Both the prototypes have been added to my GitHub.

# Features

My website consists- 

-	Navigation bar
-	API
-	Hover Image
-	Contact me form
-	Slideshows

# Validation

My whole website has been validated using a HTML, CSS and JavaScript validator. I have tested it thoroughly and there no errors.

# Issues Faced/Solved 
Responsiveness Mobile/Desktop- The main issue I faced during the project was the responsiveness of the website. The issue I was facing was when I add the ‘@media’ code in the CSS it wasn’t aligning the way it should do so I had to play around with it a lot. Also for some of the pages I had to do it individually as the code was not working correctly. The main issue was the background images on my homepage, the responsiveness on this page was not working at all as the image would just move or the navigation would mess up therefore I had to leave the responsiveness on this page out.

# How I solved this issue? (Responsiveness Mobile/Desktop-) 
To solve this issue I realised that I had missed some code out on the HTML pages, the code that was missing was the ‘Meta’ code. After I added this in the responsiveness did start to work, I then used the lab code which was provided and the full thing started to be responsive for mobile view (iPhone 5). The thing I still couldn’t solve the responsiveness for the homepage background image, I did a lot of research on the internet as well but still couldn’t get anything, so unfortunately, I had to leave it out.

Navigation Responsiveness – The issue I had with the navigation was that the navigation bar was not shrinking when the window size is changed. The navigation bar worked fine but the responsiveness was not coping. 

How I solved this issue? (Responsiveness Navigation) – To solve this issue I had missed the ‘Meta’ code out, also I had to add in ‘margin-left’ this fixed the issue.

# Issues that have not been fixed?
I did not get to solve the homepage; the issue was that the background images were not responsive. Another thing I could not solve was the API, my code is correct, but when it searches it does not display any results.
